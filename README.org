#+title: SVG Re-drawings of DROID modules

* Introduction
This repository contains my own drawings of various DROID modules that I own.

I have drawn these from reference images in Inkscape. These are not completely
to scale or absolutely perfectly correct, but may be of use to someone.

The versions in the root of the repository do not include references to fonts,
while the versions in the =font-required/= folder require the =Realtime DEMO=
font.

The DROID logo is drawn by hand by me to resemble the actual logo which I know
that it only barely does.
